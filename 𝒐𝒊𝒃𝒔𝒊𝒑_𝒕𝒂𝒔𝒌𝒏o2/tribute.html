                Bhagat Singh's sense of patriotism had been embedded in him since a very young age.
                 He was raised to value nationalism and yearns for an independent India free from British rule.
                  He developed a socialist outlook after reading a lot of European literature and developing a great desire for a
                   democratic future for his beloved nation. 
        Bhagat Singh was born a Sikh, but after seeing numerous Hindu-Muslim riots and other religious upheavals, he began to lean toward atheism.

Bhagat Singh thought that in order to attain something as precious as Independence, 
imperialism's exploitative aspect needed to be completely eradicated. According to his opinion, only an armed revolution along the
 lines of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia could bring about such transformation. He coined the phrase “Inquilab Zindabad,” which eventually became 
 the war cry of the campaign for Indian independence.
